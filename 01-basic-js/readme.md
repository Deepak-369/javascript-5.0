VARIABLE:-
-Variable is a container to store some data.
-In js we have three type of variables 
1.let:-
-Let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later .
-Now these days ,most of the cases we used let for creating variable.
-Let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most of the cases.

2.var:-
-Var is a variable which is also used for changing the variable later stage.
-Var is used in browser so now a days we are don't use var most of the time.
-
3.const:-
-const is a type of variable where we can't change our data further.
-const means constant to store some data like numbers,iteger etc..

3.What do you mean by haisting(when we donn't declsre value of variable but it execute the code).
